# Vitis Vision Library
The Vitis Vision library is a set of 60+ kernels, optimized for Xilinx FPGAs and SoCs, based on the OpenCV computer vision library. The kernels in the Vitis Vision library are optimized and supported in the Xilinx Vitis Tool Suite.

# DESIGN FILE HIERARCHY
The library is organized into the following folders -

| Folder Name | Contents |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| L1 | Examples that evaluate the Vitis Vision kernels, and demonstrate the kernels' use model in HLS flow |
| L2 | Examples that evaluate the Vitis Vision kernels, and demonstrate the kernels' use model in Vitis flow.  |
| L3 | Applications formed by stitching a pipeline of Vitis Vision functions |
| ext | Utility functions used in the opencl host code |

The organization of contents in each folder is described in the readmes of the respective folders.

## HARDWARE and SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
The Vitis Vision library is designed to work with Zynq, Zynq Ultrascale+, and Alveo FPGAs. The library has been verified on zcu102, zcu104 and U200 boards.

Vitis 2019.2 Development Environment is required to work with the library.

**Vitis Flow:**

U200 platform, available in the Vitis tool, is required to build and run the library functions on U200 PCIe board. Same applies for Zynq based platforms.
